## TemperPCE TurboGrafx/PC-Engine core

Temperpce3DS_bottom is a mod of bubble2k16 emulator that can be played only using 3DS bottom screen.

This is a port of Exophase's Temper (TurboGrafx/PC-Engine) emulator to the old 3DS and old 2DS. This port heavily relies on the 3DS's 3D GPU hardware to achieve 60 FPS (or close to 60 with frame skips). Since we are using the hardware, some games that utilise special palette effects may not work so well.
